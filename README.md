# React useEffect Hook Race Condition and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook: a race condition during data fetching, along with insufficient error handling.

The `bug.js` file showcases a component that fetches data using `fetch`.  If the fetch operation is slow, or if there is a network error, the error handling and loading states might not function correctly.  The application might render incorrectly or crash silently.

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling and state management to prevent race conditions and ensure a more robust user experience.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the behavior of the component.  Introduce delays in the network request to simulate a slow response.
5. Note that error messages might be missing or that the loading indicator fails to be updated properly.

## Solution

The solution focuses on correctly handling asynchronous operations within `useEffect` to avoid race conditions and provide informative feedback to the user in case of errors.
